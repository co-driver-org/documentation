# API Governance

API governance provides a framework to manage APIs throughout their lifecycle. It ensures APIs are secure, compliant, discoverable, and follow consistent patterns and practices.

## Why API Governance Matters

In modern software development, APIs have become the building blocks of applications. As organizations build more APIs, challenges emerge:

- **Discoverability**: How do developers find the right APIs?
- **Consistency**: Are APIs following standards?
- **Access Control**: Who can use which APIs?
- **Lifecycle Management**: How are APIs versioned, deprecated, and retired?

Without proper governance, these challenges lead to:

- Duplicated APIs and functionality
- Inconsistent documentation
- Security vulnerabilities
- Slow development cycles
- Difficulty managing breaking changes

## Core Principles of API Governance

### Standardization
Establish consistent patterns for API design, documentation, and versioning.

### Visibility
Make APIs discoverable with clear ownership and documentation.

### Security
Implement consistent authentication, authorization, and data protection.

### Lifecycle
Manage APIs from creation through deprecation and retirement.

## API Governance in Practice

Effective API governance requires:

1. **Clear Ownership**: APIs belong to specific teams
2. **Documentation Standards**: Consistent, up-to-date documentation
3. **Access Controls**: Well-defined permissions
4. **Review Processes**: Approval workflows for changes
5. **Monitoring**: Usage tracking and performance metrics

## The Codriver Approach

Codriver implements governance through:

```typescript
// Organization structure
interface Organization {
  teams: Team[];
  policies: GovernancePolicy[];
}

// Team ownership
interface API {
  owner: Team;
  subscribers: Subscriber[];
}

// Lifecycle management
enum APIStatus {
  DRAFT,
  REVIEW,
  PUBLISHED,
  DEPRECATED,
  RETIRED
}
```
